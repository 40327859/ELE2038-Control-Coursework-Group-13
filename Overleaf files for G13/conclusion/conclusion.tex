\section*{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this is the working design for the controller we came up with. It fits the system requirements, being BIBO stable, having zero offset, avoiding large amplitude oscillations, and it rejects disturbances and holding the ball close to the set point and can bring the ball back to near the set point quickly when it is pushed or pulled.
