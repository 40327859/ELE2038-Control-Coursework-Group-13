\section{Equilibrium Equations}
The equilibrium point of a stable system is the point where the system will return to despite any change of
inputs. This means that by finding a systemâ€™s equilibrium point, the stability of the system can be analysed.
\subsection*{Substituting Zero into Derivative Equations}\hfill \\
If we set all the derivatives of our variables to 0 at our equilibrium values, we get:

\begin{align}
    0 &= x_2^{e}\\
    0 &= \frac{5}{7m}  \left(mg\sin{\phi} + c\frac{x_3^{e2}}{(\delta - x_1^{e})^2} -k(x_1^{e}-d) -bx_2^{e}   \right)\\
    0 &= \frac{v^{e} - x_3^{e}R}{L_0 + L_1e^{-\alpha (\delta - x_1^{e})^2}}
\end{align}
\subsection*{Finding Equilibrium Values}
\hfill \\
Since we are told that $x^e_1 = 0.5$ , since it is stationary at this point, we can assume that $x^e_2 = 0$. If we rearrange equation 2.2 we can find the value of $x^e_3 $.
\begin{equation}
    x_3^e = \sqrt{\frac{(kx_1 - kd - mg\sin\phi)(\delta - x_1)^2}{c}}
\end{equation}
If we subsitute our constant values we get $x_3 = 0.707488266645418 $ A.
