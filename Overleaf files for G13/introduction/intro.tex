\section*{Introduction}
In this report, the results of a PID controller that has been designed to control a system that consists of a ball with a metal core on an inclined plane, held by a spring and damper system and attracted by an electromagnet, will be reported and discussed, including the calculations and code used in the process of designing the controller.
The objective for the controller is to hold the ball close to a set point that is 0.5 m down the plane from the top. The controller will need to be BIBO stable, have an offset of zero, and be tuned to avoid large amplitude oscillations and reject disturbances.
